For this project I decided to add a couple of things that I thought that we would implement in class.
First and foremost I added a currency system.
This system starts the user with 10 coins that can be used to purchase all items from the pokemart.
The pokeballs, revives, and potions all costed 3 coins, 5 coins, and 2 coins respectfully.
You can obtain coins through fighting either wild pokemon or trainers.
From a wild pokemon you get one coin, from trainers you get a coin for each pokemon defeated.
The gyms have at most 3 trainers that you can fight through.
Inbetween fights you can leave and come back, however there may be more or fewer trainers, as the time of day has changed. (They have lives you know)
You can also revisit gyms and fight once again through to gain many coins. 
The gyms get progressively harder the farther you get from spawn as well.
