For this project I have fully met the specification by printing out all 1728 potential knights tours.
The tour function is the recursive function that goes through each possible movement that the knight could make on the board.
The canMove function just determines if the move will end up on the board, and the repeats is just to see if this space has already been touched by the knight.
The printBoard function correctly displays the order of spaces in the given format from the assignment.
