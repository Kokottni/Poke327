For this project I have fully met the specification that is required in the instructions.
The paths will cross twice given by the generateRoads method that I created.
All generated maps will have pokemarts and pokecenters generated alongside a path.
There will be at least 2 areas of tall grass(;) and one region of water(~) with the possiblity of a mountain range(%) and forest (^).
Anything that is not any of the terrain I listed above will be short grass(.).
The border only has 4 exits and everything else on the border is a boulder.
The helper method for the place terrain, was created in order to not write repetitive code.
