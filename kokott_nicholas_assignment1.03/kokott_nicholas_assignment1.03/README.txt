For this project I have fully met the specification that is required in the instructions.
There is always a player generated on a path somewhere not on the border of the map.
There are two distance maps that are put out for both the rival and the hiker.
The distance maps will display after the game map is printed as well.
This assignment works in cohesion with the last assignment, so whenever you travel, the new game map will be generated alongside the distance maps for the game map.
All of the new code lies within the dijkstra_path2 algorithm, which takes in the map, character location, and an integer to determine which npc distance map is generated.
