For this assignment I have made everything to specification.
I used my last couple assignments as basis for this one and converted everything that I wrote into c++.
After I did this I made the function for the character to traverse between the maps with each direction.
This works well, there are times where it will crash and I unsure as to why it will. There is no consistency to it, it is just random.
The fly function works completely as well, you just hit f, and then type first number, space, second number.
If you input coordinates the don't work an interface will pop up telling you what to do and how to fix it.
The character will spawn on the path right in front of the east gate after using the fly function.
