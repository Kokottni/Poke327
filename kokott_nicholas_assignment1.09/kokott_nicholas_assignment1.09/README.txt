For this project I have fully met the specification provided.
I first started by adding an inventory to the pc by making a bag class and having the three required items within.
All items are stored correctly and cannot be used when you have none, every item works as intended as well.
The pokemon list tab also works directly as intended by just listing the pokemon you have and allowing you to switch between only if you have more than one.
The fights work perfectly as well and are exactly according to the specification.
When you are in the tall grass and encounter a regular pokemon you can capture it, fight it, or just run away (with potential failure).
Trainers you really only have the ability to fight as specified.
When you visit pokemarts all of your items that you started with are restored.
When you visit pokecenters all of your current pokemon are restored to full health.
