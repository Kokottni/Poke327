For this assignment I have fully met the specification that was required.
The user input works with all keys (uppercase, lowercase, and numbers).
The entering, exiting, and battling all work perfectly and have temporary interfaces for what will be added later.
For the battling, when another trainer is defeated the player swaps places with them, and that trainers move cost is set at INT_MAX.
As well as that, the key to escape the battle interface is the escape key on the key board.
The map is also colored, as are the characters. Hopefully this looks pleasing as I am color blind lol.
Exiting the game is as simple as hitting q (not case sensitive).
