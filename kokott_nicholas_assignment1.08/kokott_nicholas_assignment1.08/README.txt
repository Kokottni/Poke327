For this assignment I have fully met the specification required.
I first started out by making pokemon appear when you would walk through the tall grass.
From here I made getters for every stat needed and put them in a display for that pokemon it was encountered.
For the pokemon that the pc and npcs have I created pokemon.h to be a class that is just a pokemon.
Everything would be assigned to said pokemon and given to the pc through selection at beginning or randomly for each npc.
All pokemon have stats that are to the specification of the assignment.
