# Poke327
In this repository, I developed a 2d character pokemon game throughout one semester in CS 327.

In order to run each of these progress points in the project you need to utilize the makefile given with each subfile.
To run them you simply run the command, "make", in your cmd or linux terminal and this will generate an executable file for you.
Once this is done just run ./poke327 and the game will commence.

With each assignment part, there will be a pdf in the directory that explains what was done. Every assignment is 100% functional with the specifications provided in these pdfs.

Be warned: Once you reach 1.07 the game will have you fetching files from an Iowa State server that is only accessible if you are logged in through a VPN. Game will NOT work unless logged in.
