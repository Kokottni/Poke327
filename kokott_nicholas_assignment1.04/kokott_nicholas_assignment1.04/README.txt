For this project I did met all of the specifications sometimes.
Many times when you run the project everything works as it should.
The hikers and rivals will pathfind to the players, the pacers, wanderers, swimmers, and explorers do as they should.
You can always use the input commands (--numtrainers #) no matter if the program bugs later or not.
However, there are a couple of bugs.
Sometimes if a character spawns surrounded by terrain they cannot pass through, the game will get stuck on making them move when they cannot.
I have tried solving this problem with different solutions and I cannot fix it.
And seeing as I used professor schaeffers code to start this project, apparently it can seg fault (I have never had this happen though).
The edge of the map can also sometimes be not as it should be due to the width of the characters, but it is still the same size.
So when characters that aren't supposed to be moving diagonally look like they are, they are not.
All in all though, it is still functionally able to do everything, it is just a matter if the sequence number of a character does not get updated for some unknown reason and gets stuck.
