For this assignment I have fully met the specification required.
I created 2 new files, files.h and files.cpp that are linked and linked to poke327.cpp.
Within these files I create classes and methods used to parse and display the data from the requested files.
The program starts by asking the user which of the files the user would like to parse.
It uses the prompts from the assignment pdf for each one and based on that, it will parse the selected file.
Each line is parsed and displayed one by one until it reaches the end of the file.
Once all data is displayed the program ends and it can be rerun to see the other files.
